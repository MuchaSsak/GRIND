# GRIND

A mobile app for tracking your gym progress, workout plans and more ðŸ’ª

To download this application from EAS, [click here](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/qHXoU4Pm4zx7mvHXjNgCBM.apk) ðŸ‘ˆ

Unfortunately I do not own a Google Play Console developer account, nor the Apple Developer Program membership, so instead I built the artifact for Android only (.apk file)

_Note: this project is unfinished and probably not ever be. I needed to learn RN and so I did, however I'm getting busy with some other life stuff so I'm abandoning it for an undisclosed period of time :)_
